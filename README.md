# Ahri-Bot2
A rewritten version of Ahri-Bot, considerably better code management but still not optimal.

This is a re-programmed version of my old league of legends bot. My old league of legends discord bot (during its peak) ran in over 900 hunderd servers with an estimate
of 10,000 users. This bot was made to improve on all aspects of the old bot including code simplicity and flow.
I abandonded it to work on other projects and because Riot changed all their API rendering my python implementations useless.

Some notable features:
  -The ability to make embeds from just a text data. This would allow anyone to custom the way the bot displays their data by utilizing a bunch of preset
    variables and objects which could all be accessed from the text files. All "official" embeds were built using this feature. Text embeds can be found in ahri/default_embeds
    
  -A very intuitive UI that shows only necessary information. I spent a lot of time making things look as good as possible because I felt that other bots looked
   message and not very clean.
   
  -A "stock" market, this was going to be a type of game implemented into the bot where people could "buy" (all fake currency) into video game characters and depending
   on game patches the value of a character would rise and fall. I was planning on implementing a bunch of algoritms to assist with the stock market game but never
   got around to it.
  
  -Slash commands- all of the bot's commmands were through discord's new slash command system which made it easy for syntax purposes.
